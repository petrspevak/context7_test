# Context7 test (reference materials for the blog article)

**My humble test of Context7, an extension that provides relevant documentation to AI coding assistants.**

## Test date: 2025-08-14

## Information
- You can resolve tool and model from the directory names.
- Part of the right solution was to save a file with the command in `packages/ourcms-shop-bundle/src/Command`. If stored in the wrong place, it's mentioned in `note.md` file next to the file with command.
- In some solutions the repository class was also edited. If in the wrong place, it's also mentioned.
- Excuse me for some comments and strings in the Czech language.
